  summary: "Implementation of the 'viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma',  'inferno', and
    'cividis' color maps for 'R'. 'viridis', 'magma', 'plasma',  and 'inferno' are ported
    from 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/>, a  popular plotting library for 'python'.
    'cividis', was developed by Jamie R.  Nu\xF1ez and Sean M. Colby. These color maps
    are designed in such a way that  they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform,
    both in regular  form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also
    designed to  be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness
    (all  color maps in this package) and color vision deficiency ('cividis' only).
    \ This is the 'lite' version of the more complete 'viridis' package that can  be
    found at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>."
